### Conventions and other comments:
# 
# EXIT CODES FOR SCHEME HANDLERS
# 0 is for everything went fine
# 64 is for "not supported/the problem won't be solved by polling". This is for things like: unmet dependencies, not supported at all, etc
# everything else means just "error". Use 1, please. So other codes can be used if needed
