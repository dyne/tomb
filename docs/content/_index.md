Tomb is a 100% free and open source tool that facilitates managing secret files in volumes protected by strong encryption.

Tomb’s ambition is to improve safety by way of:

- a minimalist design consisting of small and readable code
- the facilitation of good practices, i.e.: key/storage physical separation
- the adoption of a few standards and battle-tested components

### How it works

[![Tomb on LinuxActionShow 2014](/tomb/images/linuxshow-tomb.webp )](https://tv.dyne.org/w/uEzB5L3NFxUF3MTbZC2m4f)

We design Tomb’s hidden file encryption to generate encrypted storage folders to be opened and closed using associated key files, which are also protected with a password chosen by the user.

A tomb is a file whose contents are kept secret and indistinguishable; it can be safely renamed, transported and hidden in filesystems; its keys should be kept separate, for instance, keeping the tomb file on your computer’s hard disk and the key files on a USB stick. Once open, the tomb looks like a folder.

Tomb derives from scripts used in the dyne:bolic 100% Free GNU/Linux distribution and a shell script (Zsh) using standard filesystem tools (GNU) and the cryptographic API of the Linux kernel (dm-crypt and LUKS via cryptsetup). Tomb’s status and error messages are translated into many human languages and have multiple graphical applications to operate.
